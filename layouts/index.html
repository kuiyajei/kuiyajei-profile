			<h1>Welkam.</h1>


			<p>In here you'll find out more <a href="/profile/about">about me</a> and a bunch of dev-related notes 
				I kept for myself that might be of some use to you.</p>

			<p>My notes aren't very articulate, mind you. All descriptions and explanations 
				found here are written in simple language. Not because I want you to understand, 
				but because my vocabulary's just lacking :P</p>
